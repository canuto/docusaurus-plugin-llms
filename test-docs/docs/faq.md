# Frequently Asked Questions

Find answers to commonly asked questions about our product.

## General Questions

### What is this product?

Our product is a comprehensive SDK that allows developers to integrate with our platform services. It provides a simple, consistent API for accessing data, performing operations, and implementing custom workflows.

### Who should use this SDK?

The SDK is designed for developers who need to integrate our services into their applications. It's particularly useful for:

- Frontend developers building web or mobile applications
- Backend developers creating services that interact with our platform
- DevOps engineers setting up automated workflows

### Is the SDK free to use?

The SDK itself is free and open-source. However, usage of our platform services may require a subscription or pay-as-you-go plan depending on your usage volume. See our [pricing page](https://example.com/pricing) for details.

## Installation & Setup

### What are the system requirements?

- Node.js v14 or higher
- Internet connection for API calls
- Valid API credentials

### How do I install the SDK?

```bash
# Using npm
npm install @example/sdk

# Using yarn
yarn add @example/sdk

# Using pnpm
pnpm add @example/sdk
```

### Where do I get an API key?

You can obtain an API key by:

1. Creating an account on our [developer portal](https://developers.example.com)
2. Creating a new project
3. Navigating to the "API Keys" section
4. Generating a new key

## Troubleshooting

### Why am I getting authentication errors?

Common reasons for authentication errors:

1. **Invalid API key**: Double-check that your API key is correct and hasn't expired
2. **Permissions issue**: Ensure your API key has the necessary permissions for the operations you're trying to perform
3. **Environment mismatch**: Verify you're using the correct key for your environment (development vs. production)

### How do I handle rate limiting?

Our API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage. If you encounter rate limit errors (HTTP 429), you should:

1. Implement exponential backoff in your retry logic
2. Consider caching frequently accessed data
3. Optimize your code to batch requests where possible
4. If you consistently hit rate limits, contact us about higher-tier plans

### The SDK isn't working in my environment

If you're experiencing issues:

1. Check that you're using a compatible Node.js version
2. Verify your network connectivity
3. Enable debug mode for detailed logs:
   ```javascript
   const sdk = new SDK({
     debug: true,
     // other options...
   });
   ```
4. Check our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/example/sdk/issues) to see if it's a known problem

## Advanced Usage

### Can I use the SDK in a browser environment?

Yes, the SDK can be used in both Node.js and browser environments. However, for browser usage:

1. Never include your API key directly in client-side code
2. Set up a proxy service for secure API communication
3. Use our specific browser bundle:
   ```html
   <script src="https://cdn.example.com/sdk/browser.min.js"></script>
   ```

### How do I handle webhook events?

To process webhook events:

1. Set up a webhook endpoint in your application
2. Register the endpoint URL in our developer portal
3. Use the SDK's webhook verification to ensure the events are authentic:
   ```javascript
   import { verifyWebhookSignature } from '@example/sdk/webhooks';
   
   app.post('/webhooks', (req, res) => {
     const isValid = verifyWebhookSignature(
       req.body,
       req.headers['x-webhook-signature'],
       process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET
     );
     
     if (!isValid) {
       return res.status(401).send('Invalid signature');
     }
     
     // Process the webhook event
     handleEvent(req.body);
     
     res.status(200).send('OK');
   });
   ```
